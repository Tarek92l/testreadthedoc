About the platform
==================

The platform project is an ECLIPSE™ project. It defines your entire
Linux environment definition. The platform consists of a set of items
(Packages, Kernel, Rootfs …) that will populate your embedded Linux. It
is used as a hub to control and configure the build. The compiler used
to build the platform has to be GCC-based.
